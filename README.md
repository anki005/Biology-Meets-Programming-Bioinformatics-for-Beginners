This repository contains the programming exercises for the Coursera course called Biology Meets Programming : Bioinformatics for Beginners by University of California San Diego.
The course is amazing for anyone who wants to get a head start into the Bioinformatics field from Computer Science. I enjoyed a lot and hope you will too!
